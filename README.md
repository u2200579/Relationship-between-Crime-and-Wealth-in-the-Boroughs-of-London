# Relationship-between-Crime-and-Wealth-in-the-Boroughs-of-London
Project studies the correlation between wealth of a borough and the level of crime within said borough.

This project also leveraged a handy machine learning/data analysis tool Weka to iterate the modelling process quickly. Weka is great when working with tabular data and allows experiments to be set up in record time.
